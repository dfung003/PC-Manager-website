# PCManager

## About
This is a simple blog-type organizer application which allows users to keep track of 
their PC hardware/parts when trying to build their very own PC. Users will be able to
save their PC builds and review PC products that will save into a database.

## Motivation
This website was made for those who share an interest in building PCs. There are so
many components involved that it is nice to have a website to keep track of all of
your PC hardware before installing each piece. I used PCPartPicker as my inspiration
for this project.
